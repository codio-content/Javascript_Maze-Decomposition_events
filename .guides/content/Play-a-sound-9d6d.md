We have a special function in our game called 'playSound()'. You can use it in any of the following ways.

- `playSound('bump')` makes a noise that you might make when hitting a wall
- `playSound('energy')` makes a noise that you might make when hitting an energy store
- `playSound('fight')` makes a noise that you might make when hitting a monster
- `playSound('kill')` makes a noise that you might make when you have hit a monster enough times to kill it
- `playSound('goal-reached')` makes a noise that you might make when you have hit a monster enough times to kill it


Play with the code to experiment with these sounds. You can add more than one sound if you like.


We'll use `playSound()` in context in a moment.
