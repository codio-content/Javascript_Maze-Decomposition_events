We have a special function in our game called 'playSound()'. You can use it in any of the following ways.

- `playSound('bump')` makes a noise that you might make when hitting a wall
- `playSound('energy')` makes a noise that you might make when hitting an energy store
- `playSound('fight')` makes a noise that you might make when hitting a monster
- `playSound('kill')` makes a noise that you might make when you have hit a monster enough times to kill it
- `playSound('goal-reached')` makes a noise that you might make when you have hit a monster enough times to kill it

## Have a play
Play with the code to experiment with these sounds. 

- Change the `playSound()` function as described above
- Try adding more than one sound


We'll use `playSound()` in the context of our game in a moment.
