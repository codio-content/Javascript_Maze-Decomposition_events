We have a special function in our game called 'playSound()'. You can use it in any of the following ways.

- `playSound()` just beeps
- `playSound('bump')` makes a bumping sound
- `playSound('ping')` pings
- `playSound('explode')` should be obvious

Play with the code to experiment with these sounds. We'll use this in a moment.
