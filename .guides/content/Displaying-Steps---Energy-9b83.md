Let's deal with the simple displaying of the steps and energy levels.

For now, we will calculate the number of steps and the energy level of the player for you. We just worry about the display at this stage.

## Display
To display the steps and energy levels, we use the following functions. `energy` and `steps` are variables that contain the current energy levels.

```javascript
updateEnergy(energy)
updateSteps(steps)
```

|||challenge
Update the event handler code on the left to properly display the energy and steps.

Play the game and grab some energy, hit monsters and check that the status display works properly.
