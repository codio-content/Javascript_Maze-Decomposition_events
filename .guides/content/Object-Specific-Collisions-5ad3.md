In the last example, no matter what object your player collided with, you played one sound.

We can also play different sounds depending on which object is collided with.

Look at the code on the left hand side. We have provided 3 different event handlers. One for each type of collision.

1. Play the `bump` sound for a collision with a wall.
1. Play the `ping` sound for a collision with an energy store.
1. Play the `explode` sound for a collision with a monster.

When you're done, press the button below.
