In the last example, no matter what object your player collided with, you played one sound.

We can also play different sounds depending on which object is collided with.

|||challenge
Look at the code on the left hand side. We have provided 4 different event handlers. One for each type of collision.

1. Play the `bump` sound for a collision with a wall.
1. Play the `energy` sound for a collision with an energy store.
1. Play the `fight` sound for a collision with a monster.
1. Play the `goal-reached` sound when you reach the exit.
1. Show a message for each collision as well saying simple 'hit wall', 'hit energy' and 'hit monster'.

When you're done, press the button below.
